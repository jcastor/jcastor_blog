	        <b> Python </b>
            <br/>
            I have been using Python for a significant time now, and am becoming more familiar with using it for my day to day programming tasks, and it is my go-to language that I look to use when starting new projects.  I particularly enjoy using the Django framework with Python to create web applications.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Relational Databases</b>
            <br/>
            I have experience mostly with PostgreSQL, but am comfortable learning the nuances of other database systems.  I also am experienced in using Object Relational Managers (ORM's) such as the one built into Django, as well as some experience with Sqlalchemy.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b> C/C++ Programming </b>
            <br/>
            During my time in school, I have gained experience working in C/C++ and have found it to be a language that I enjoy using.  I have mostly worked in C, and have some experience in C++.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b> Networking </b>
            <br/>
            I have spent time experimenting with TCP/IP protocol and using some socket programming libraries in C/C++.  As well as setting up simple servers to use with different programs, I also have experience with non-standard firmware for routers (DD-WRT).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b> Software Packages </b>
            <br/>
            Familiar with Microsoft Office, Open Office, Libre Office, Dev C++, Eclipse, and I am highly adaptable in quickly changing technical environments.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b> Command Line </b>
            <br/>
            I am able to use both the Linux/Windows command lines proficiently.
            <br/>
			<br/>
			<b>Operating Systems</b>
			<br/>
			Experience and Familiarity with:
			<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>Linux (Debian, Ubuntu)</li>
				<li>Mac OS X</li>
				<li>Windows (XP, Vista, 7)</li>
			</ul>

	        <b> Soldering </b>
            <br/>
            Due to my time doing electronics repair, I became skilled with a soldering iron while I made cables and added/removed various components, including working with SMT components.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b> Electronics Testing/Troubleshooting </b>
            <br/>
            In past work experiences I have spent time repairing broken equipment that involved researching schematics to determine problems, make corrections and then test properly to verify device functionality.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b> Lab Equipment </b>
            <br/>
            I am familiar with Oscilloscopes, Multimeters, and other pieces of lab testing equipment.

            <b> Customer Service </b>
            <br/>
            I have held positions in customer service and learned quickly how to provide courteous service to both internal and external customers.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b> Learning & Research </b>
            <br/>
            During my time repairing electronics, I quickly had to learn about the different types of equipment and find ways to fix them.  Projects I have worked on also often require researching different products to determine the most effective solution.
            <br/>
            <br/>
			<b> Time Management </b>
            <br/>
            I have developed my time management skills to keep track of the work I accomplish in order to determine proper billable hours as well as manage my time when working independently.
